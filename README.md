# GoPro 360 Metadata

## In one sentence

This repository exists to accumulate and understand the metadata produced by GoPro 360 cameras.

## Why we built this

We build software that processes 360 video and image files. In many cases these files contain telemetry data (e.g are geotagged).

Before processing them, we need to understand the format (or standard) of files each camera produces to process it correctly.
